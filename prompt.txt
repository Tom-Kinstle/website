Create a personal/professional website for Thomas Kinstle, a data scientist with a background in healthcare, logistics, and defense. The site should use a black background with white font and incorporate accents of wave imagery—specifically cropped sections of two image files: wave.jpg and Impression_waves.jpg. The visual tone should be minimal but bold, blending a technical and introspective personality.

Theme & Design:

Dark mode (black background, white text)

Accent visuals: sliced wave art throughout the site as separators or backdrops

Clean, modern layout (use grid or cards to organize content)

Include four images:

me.png (professional photo)

thinker.png with caption: Architect (Introverted +61, Intuitive +92, Thinking +83, Judging +74)

WSR.jpg (caption: Warfighter Support Representative – Afghanistan)

wave.jpg and Impression_waves.jpg (for design elements, use like abstract page breaks or overlays)

Sections to Include:

Home / Hero Section:

Large photo (me.png) with greeting:
"Hi, I'm Tom — a data scientist who turns complex problems into strategic insights."

Subtext:
Driven by curiosity, honed through defense logistics, and fueled by data.

About Me:

Text from LinkedIn summary (edited for tone):

I'm a data scientist with a knack for solving real-world problems across healthcare, logistics, and defense. A graduate of TripleTen’s intensive data science program, I bring a deep skillset in Python, machine learning, statistics, and visualization.

My path’s been unconventional: from Air Force engine work to civilian defense logistics, to data science—fueled by a love for science fiction, museums, cooking, and strategy games.

I’m currently exploring geospatial data, time series forecasting, and AI applications that enhance operational efficiency. Let’s build something valuable together.


Personality Snapshot:

thinker.png with caption as listed

Include MBTI-inspired one-liner: Strategic by nature, structured by design.

Optional addition: brief paragraph on love of problem-solving, logical structure, and lifelong learning
